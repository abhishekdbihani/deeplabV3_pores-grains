# deeplabV3_pores-grains

This repository contains a model of [DeeplabV3+ Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02611) in Python for semantic segmentation of pores and grains. 

It has been modified from https://github.com/rishizek/tensorflow-deeplab-v3-plus which was made for segmentation of [PASCAL VOC dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/)

Note: It was not directly forked as size of model files required [LTS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) , which is not supported for forked public repositories.

This trained model can be used for detection of pores and large grains from SEM images of shales / mudrocks. An example is shown in the below image. The original dataset can be found here: https://www.digitalrocksportal.org/projects/42
