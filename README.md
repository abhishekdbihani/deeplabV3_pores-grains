# deeplabV3_pores-grains
This repository contains a model of DeeplabV3+ Model (https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02611) in Python for semantic segmentation of pores and grains. 

It has been modified from https://github.com/rishizek/tensorflow-deeplab-v3-plus which was made for segmentation of PASCAL VOC dataset

Note: It was not directly forked as size of model files required https://git-lfs.github.com/ , which is not supported for forked public repositories.

This trained model can be used for detection of pores and large grains from SEM images of shales / mudrocks. An example is shown in the below image.
